# Prism

A Light synchronizer software for Asus Aura, AlienFX, and Corsair iCUE devices.

## Installation

Compile and run.

## Notes

- Most of the devices should work but not all of them.
- Supported devices must have their drivers installed.
- Asus Aura v1.07 or above might not work. (Install older version of Aura, Aura v1.07 is broken)
- Dell's AlienFX compatible devices might not work. (Mainly anything other then mouse and keyboard)
- Newer (2019+) iCUE devices might not work.
